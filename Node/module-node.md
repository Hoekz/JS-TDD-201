# Node

Because of the scope of NodeJS and available resources, this module will contain no content. Instead, it is suggested
to read the following resources: [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest), [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch),
[mock-fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-fs), [aws-sdk-mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk-mock).

It is also recommended that you familiarize yourself with your library of choice's mocking approach, as mocking is
a very powerful and easily applied tool in JavaScript.
