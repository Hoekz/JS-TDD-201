# Angular

Because of the scope associated with `Angular`, as well as the already existing resources, this module is currently empty. This
may change in the future as less common testing scenarios would benefit from documentation. It is recommended that you read
and explore the following resources instead: [Angular Testing Guide](https://angular.io/guide/testing) and (optionally)
[migrating to jest](https://medium.com/angular-in-depth/migrate-your-angular-library-to-jest-faba9579591a).

While this course contains modules on testing "Dates", "Timing", and "Network", `Angular` has its own approach to testing
[asynchronous code](https://angular.io/guide/testing-components-scenarios#async-test-with-fakeasync) which covers many of the
same situations using `jasmine`, so while these modules may be helpful to review, consider reading the official docs as well.
