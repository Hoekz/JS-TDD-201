# Dates

This module covers working with `Date` in JavaScript. Each chapter covers a particular testing library or tool:

 - `jest` - `useFakeTimers`
 - `sinon` - `useFakeTimers`
 - `jasmine` - `clock -> mockDate`
 - `MockDate` - `set`

In some cases, it can be enough to simply mock `Date.now` as well, as many libraries use only this call before
applying custom functionality.

## jest

This chapter goes over mocking the `Date` object in `jest`. Jest actually uses sinon's `fake-timers` module
under the hood, which means the solution ends up very similar.
