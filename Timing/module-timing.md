# Timing

This module focuses on testing around the timing functions `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.

Mocking `requestAnimationFrame` is not covered, though is reasonably achievable.

## sinon

This chapter covers testing usage of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` using `sinon` with the test runner `mocha`.
