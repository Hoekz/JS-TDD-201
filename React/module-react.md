# React

Because of the scope of testing in React, as well as the aready available resources, this module contains no content
yet. In the event that more obscure testing cases deserve an example, they will be added here. In the mean time, it
is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these common scenarios and tools: [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest),
[@testing-library/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react) and other `@testing-library` packages,
and the modules "Dates", "Timing", and "Network".

It is also worth looking into [enzyme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enzyme), although many `React` projects are moving
away from it as the philosophy around testing `React` has shifted to a more framework agnostic approach. Still, `enzyme` is
very common among already existing projects and still sees a lot of use.
