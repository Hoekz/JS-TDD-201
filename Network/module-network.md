# Network

This module focuses on testing network activity, particularly around `fetch`. While in many cases it may
seem more appropriate to mock at the service level such as when unit testing a component, a robust mocking
of the network layer can lead to more consistent tests, less code duplication, and more confidence in the
full vertical slice of a webpage.

The chapters are:
 - Mocking fetch yourself
 - Using `msw`
 - Mocking websockets
